**Architecture Review Reflection**

In our discussion we touched upon each of the key questions that we outlined going into the review.

While discussing our stretch goals, we received a lot of helpful feedback regarding which of our potential stretch goals were most interesting. Some ideas that we talked about included photo mosaics, the potential of extending our project to create three dimensional lego sets from .stl files, and including filter options to the GUI so that users have color options when building their Lego picture.

Additionally, we talked about the potential of having our program put the Lego bricks needed to create the lego picture into a cart on the Lego website to lower the activation energy required to actually continue to making the lego picture. Other ideas discussed included ways of orienting the GUI to optimize it for the user to control the size of the lego picture.

After talking about the feedback and suggestions we received, we decided that feeding in .stl files and producing Lego instructions would be a very cool stretch goal and something that we want to pursue.

During the review, Sophie mentioned a different way of getting the average RGB value of the Lego brick images that might be useful. She asked if we were screen grabbing and then using a color picker to get the RGB value. We hadn’t originally planned to use opencv, but we will look into it and its functionality because it may be easier to implement. After asking about how to scrape off of a website that does not have a unique URL, our peer team and Ninja said we should try to scrape off of a different website that has the same information or suggested that we could just hardcode the prices, dimensions, and colors into a dictionary for the MVP. Moving forward, we will look at other websites and if those aren’t easy to scrape, we will put the information into a dictionary because it is still reasonable to handle.

The review went well in assessing where we are right now in the project, where we expect to take it, and how we can take it further. Based on the context and work we have achieved right now we are confident in our ability to implement a minimum viable product that will meet our expectations with time to spare for going beyond. Based on the positive feedback from our peers about the user interface and capabilities of our project we received both validation for the ideas we already have planned and got new directions we can take the final project in. Overall, we gained a better perspective of our previous brainstorming and the scope of the project with regards to the coding and ideation potential that exists for us to explore if we want to.

We stuck fairly close to our planned agenda and got useful feedback on the various components of our project. We laid out all of our information in a slideshow, which was beneficial when we were trying to present our ideas and the approaches we plan to take.  In regards to providing enough background and context, we explained our project thoroughly without overwhelming our audience with technical details that were not pertinent.

One thing that we can improve for our next technical review is to have less detail on every slide. We could prepare them to serve as conversation starters about the things that we want to get out of the review and the architecture that we are preparing/want to prepare. Also, in order to better the next technical review, we can go over the slideshow that we prepared before we start the review. 
Although we decided to not necessarily follow the PowerPoint, we still went by the slides. This caused some problems with coherence of the conversation that we were having and caused us to use our time that we could have used to get more feedback on detailing the problems that we had.
