# (LEGGO) Brick and Build Your Image: Build an Image of Your Choice out of LEGOs
This project includes code that lets a user input an image and returns a pixelated version of the original, but with its pixels represented as LEGO bricks. The program also lets a user specify a LEGO base plate size and outputs the number of each color brick needed and the total cost of the bricks.
